# Favourite Things Mini App (HTML, PHP and SQL linking)

This application is a one page app meant to display JavaScript, MySQL and PHP functionality by showing/replacing content when events are triggered (i.e. previous or next button clicked). It displays a few random hobbies and intrests of mine, but the main goal of this assignment is to show my skills as a developer.

Ironically, the app in its current state does not function as intended. I tried to connect the PHPMyAdmin database to an interactive HTML element to no avail. I will work to fix these issues in the future.

### To Do

- Fix the PHP calls to the database that do not work at the moment
- Additional JS is required

### Instructions for Use

- Click the green 'Code' button and hit 'Download ZIP'
- Download the ZIP

- Email me (at bottom) for suggestions if you enjoy my work and want to collaborate
